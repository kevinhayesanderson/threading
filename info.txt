Context Switching:
thread scheduler
CLR assigns local memory stack for each thread
static variables are shared between threads
Timeslicing in single processor -> rapidly switch execution between each of the active threads
								-> tens of milliseconds in windows

preempted thread -> thread that has the execution interrupted, usually by timeslicing
				 -> thread has no control over when and where it is preempted
